# Updating {{site.data.keyword.datashield_short}}
{: #update}

After {{site.data.keyword.datashield_short}} is installed on your cluster, you can update at any time.
{: shortdesc}

## Setting cluster context
{: #update-context}

1. Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI. Follow the prompts in the CLI to complete logging in. If you have a federated ID, append the `--sso` option to the end of the command.

  ```
  ibmcloud login
  ```
  {: codeblock}

2. Set the context for your cluster.

  ```
  ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
  ```
  {: codeblock}

3. Optional: If you don't know the email that is associated with the administrator or the admin account ID, run the following command.

  ```
  ibmcloud account show
  ```
  {: codeblock}

4. Get the Ingress subdomain for your cluster.

  ```
  ibmcloud ks cluster get --cluster <cluster_name>
  ```
  {: codeblock}

## Updating with Helm
{: #update-helm}

To update to the newest version with the Helm chart, run the following command.

1. Delete the job for your current version of Data Shield.

  ```
  kubectl delete job $(kubectl get jobs -o custom-columns=:metadata.name | grep cockroachdb-init)
  ```
  {: codeblock}

2. Update your chart.

  ```
  helm upgrade <chart-name> iks-charts/ibmcloud-data-shield --set enclaveos-chart.Manager.AdminEmail=<admin email> --set enclaveos-chart.Manager.AdminName=<admin name> --set enclaveos-chart.Manager.AdminIBMAccountId=<hex account ID> --set global.IngressDomain=<your cluster's ingress domain>
  ```

      <td>Optional: If you [configured an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Container Registry](/docs/data-shield?topic=data-shield-convert) you must append the Docker configuration to the update command.</td>

      <td><code>--set global.OpenShiftEnabled=true</code></td>
      <td>Optional: If you're working with an OpenShift cluster, be sure to append the OpenShift tag to your installation command.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>--set Manager.FailOnGroupOutOfDate=true</code></td>
      <td>Optional: By default, node enrollment and the issuing of application certificates succeed. If you want the operations to fail if your platform microcode is out of date, append the flag to your update command. You are alerted in your dashboard when your service code is out of date. Note: It is not possible to change this option on existing clusters.</td>

    <tr>
      <td><code>--set enclaveos-chart.Ias.Mode=IAS_API_KEY</code></td>
      <td>Optional: You can use your own IAS API key. To do so, you must first obtain a linkable subscription for the Intel SGX Attestation Service. Then, generate a secret in your cluster by running the following command: <code>kubectl create secret generic ias-api-key --from-literal=env=<TEST/PROD> --from-literal=spid=&lt;spid&gt; --from-literal=api-key=&lt;apikey&gt;</code>. Note: By default, IAS requests are made through a proxy service.</td>

## Updating {{site.data.keyword.datashield_short}} for Ubuntu 18.04
{: #upgrade-ubuntu-18.04}

If you're using Ubuntu 16.04, you can upgrade the cluster nodes that run {{site.data.keyword.datashield_short}} to Ubuntu 18.04.

Before you upgrade your cluster nodes, be sure to update {{site.data.keyword.datashield_short}} to version 1.23.965 or higher. If you encounter any issues during the upgrade, check the [troubleshooting steps](/docs/data-shield?topic=data-shield-troubleshooting#ts-problem-updating-data-shield) or contact IBM support.
{: note}

1. Update {{site.data.keyword.datashield_short}} to version 1.23.965 or higher.

2. Add all Ubuntu 18.04 nodes to your cluster and wait until they are ready.

   A node is ready when its status in the UI is displayed as `Normal`. You can also verify the status of a worker node by running the `kubectl get nodes` command.
   {: tip}
3. Remove `X` number of Ubuntu 16.04 nodes at a time from the cluster, where `N` is less than half of the CockroachDB replicas (`X < global.ServiceReplicas/2`).        

   For example, for a 3-node cluster, remove 1 node at a time. For a 10-node cluster, remove 3, 3, and 4 nodes at a time.
4. [Update to the newest version by using Helm](#update-helm).

    This step ensures that your Ubuntu 18.04 nodes get the required labeling, and it prepares your {{site.data.keyword.datashield_short}} resources to begin to run on them.

5. Verify that all {{site.data.keyword.datashield_short}} pods are up and running and that none of them are in pending state.
6. Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 until all the Ubuntu 16.04 nodes are removed from the cluster.
7. Manually delist the removed nodes from the UI.

## Upgrade {{site.data.keyword.datashield_short}} Cluster to IKS 1.18
{: #upgrade-IKS-1.18}


Before you upgrade the cluster, be sure to update {{site.data.keyword.datashield_short}} to version 1.25 or higher. If the current version installed is less than version 1.25, then first upgrade to version 1.25 and then follow the IKS upgrade process below. To see the current data shield version, use the command:
{: note}

```
helm ls
```

1. First upgrade the master node to IKS 1.18, that is (IKS 1.16.XXX -> 1.17.XXX -> 1.18.XXX).

2. Upgrade `X` number of worker nodes at a time from the cluster, where `X` is strictly less than half of the CockroachDB replicas (`X < global.ServiceReplicas/2`).

For example, for a 3-node cluster, upgrade 1 node at a time. For a 10-node cluster, upgrade 3, 3, and 4 nodes at a time, respectively.

3. Verify that all {{site.data.keyword.datashield_short}} pods are up and running and that none of them are in `pending` state.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all the nodes are upgraded from IKS 1.16 to 1.18 in the cluster.
